# Hospitalization Prediction Model Improvement
Apply multiple methods taught in Advanced Python(DS3001) to speed up original project code.

## The Python files
There 6 python files:

01_Merged_original_Step1.ipynb <br />
02_Merged_original_Step2.ipynb <br />
03_Merged_improved_Step1(withCython.ipynb <br />
04_Merged_improved_Step1(withoutCython).ipynb <br />
05_Merged_improved_Step2.ipynb <br />
06_Seperated_original&improved_Step1&Step2.ipynb

## How to run the files:
### Step1, run 01 and 02 ipynb files - Original running time
01 and 02 ipynb files return a total running time of original codes.<br />

### Step2, run 03, 04 and 05 ipynb files - Improved running time
03, 04 and 05 files return a total running time of improved codes. 02 and 03 provide two versions of speeding up by with or without Cython method .<br />

### Step3(Optional), run 06 ipynb files - Detailed comparing
06 file provides a detailed comparing of between original codes and improved codes, chunks by chunks

You need to put the ipynb files and dataset under the same directory, otherwise you need to specify to loading path of dataset in the ipynb files before you run them.

## Dataset
You can find the dataset in the following links:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aJs25Fs2Nd_sGwew-B03tOVa2n9kpdxb

In the Dataset folder, there are 7 csv files, please download all of them.

## Requirements
